Connections
  Discussion
    You're interacting with Some database whenever you use the web.
    What kind of data do you think is searched for when you see your posts on Facebook?
    What kind of data is searched when you enter your debit card into an ATM?
Concepts
  Data can be stored in a binary format, and read by a program
  That program has a language you use to search the data
  Structuring Data
    Uniqueness: The ID field.
  A command runs once and finishes
  Connecting to a Database with Ruby.

  CREATE TABLE COMPANY(
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY   AUTOINCREMENT,
      NAME           TEXT      NOT NULL,
      AGE            INT       NOT NULL,
      ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
      SALARY         REAL
  );

  INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...)
  VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);

  UPDATE table_name
  SET field=value, field=value
  WHERE field=value

  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE field=value


Challenges
  How would you return all of the rows in the artists table?
    SELECT * FROM artists;
  How would you select and artist with the name "Black Eyed Peas"
    SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name="Black Eyed Peas";
    SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name LIKE "%B%"; for like
  How would you create a table named 'fans' with an autoincrementing ID that's a primary key and a name field of type text
  CREATE TABLE fans(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
  name TEXT)

  How would you alter the fans table to have a artist_id column type integer?
    ALTER TABLE fans 
    ADD COLUMN artist_id INTEGER;
  How would you add yourself as a fan of the Black Eyed Peas? 169
    INSERT INTO fans (name, artist_id) VALUES ("BEEF", 169)
  How would you update your name to be your wu-tang name? name http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php
  How would you return students that are not fans of the black eyed peas. Find Black Eyed Peas by name

  require 'sqlite3'
  db = SQLite3::Database.new('my_database.db')
  db.results_as_hash = true
  p db.execute('SELECT * FROM artists')

  query = <<-SQL
