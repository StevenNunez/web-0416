Issues with JavaScript

Review
  Scope
  functions 
    return values
    functions as objects
  closures, they are things

Build an example app
  Superheros
    name, super power, description
  / -> form for adding new ones
  /superheros
  /superheros/7

New Stuff
  Making new objects
  new constructor functions, prototypes
  this, this, this

  $('form').on('submit', superHeroController.submitForm)
