Can we review control flow in JS? Lots of trouble with hoisting.

In the ATM lab, I had to move my definition of balance inside the main function. It wouldn't work when I defined it globally. Why wouldn't defining it globally work?

*I feel like I don't truly understand 'event'. Specifically, event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()

*Still having trouble with 'this' . How does it inherit its value. Is there a hierarchy when its nested within functions?

When a page loads and runs all of your Javascript functions, why does it also access all the 'on click' listeners? Those elements or buttons haven't actually been clicked

What's the difference between a JavaScript object and a hash/map?

"- var $paragraph = $(“<p>Hello!</p>”)
- var paragraph = $(“<p>Hello!</p>”)
When would you choose one over the other? Can you give some examples."
